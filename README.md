# Ace the Inteview
Ace the Interview is an single-page application (SPA) for job seekers who want to practice their interview skills. Questions are randomly chosen from a pool of over 200 questions and there are optional timers for preparing and answering questions. It attempts to replicate the experience of recorded video interview services (but without actually recording the answers.)

React, Sass
